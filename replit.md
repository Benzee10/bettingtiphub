## Adding New Ebooks

### Easy Method: Ebook Generator (Recommended)

3. Click "Generate Ebook Files"
4. Download the ebook page HTML file and save it in `ebooks/` folder
5. Download the homepage card HTML file and save it in `cards/` folder
6. Done! The new ebook automatically appears on the homepage - no coding needed!

**How it works:**
- The homepage (`index.html`) automatically loads all card files from the `cards/` folder
- When you add a new card file to the folder, it instantly appears on the homepage
- No need to manually edit `index.html` anymore!

### Manual Method: Template System
1. Copy `ebooks/_TEMPLATE.html`
2. Rename and customize
3. Create a card file in `cards/` folder (copy format from existing cards)
4. The new ebook will automatically appear on the homepage
