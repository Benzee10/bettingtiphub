HOW TO ADD A NEW EBOOK
======================

Follow these simple steps to add a new ebook to your site:

STEP 1: Create the Ebook Page
------------------------------
1. Copy the file "_TEMPLATE.html"
2. Rename it to something like "your-ebook-name.html" (use lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces)
3. Open the file and edit these sections (search for "EDIT:" comments):

   - Title and subtitle in the header
   - Ebook cover title
   - Price (appears twice - in cover and payment section)
   - Description paragraphs
   - 3-4 benefit items (you can add/remove benefit items as needed)
   - Payment details (account number, bank name)
   - WhatsApp message text
   - WhatsApp link text

4. Update the WhatsApp number: Replace "234XXXXXXXXXX" with your actual number


STEP 2: Add to Homepage
-----------------------
1. Open "index.html" (the one in the main folder, not in ebooks folder)
2. Find the section that says "<!-- Add more ebook cards here -->"
3. Copy this code and paste it there:

            <div class="ebook-card">
                <h3>YOUR EBOOK TITLE</h3>
                <div class="price">₦0,000</div>
                <p>Short description of what this ebook is about.</p>
                <a href="ebooks/your-ebook-name.html" class="btn">View Details</a>
            </div>

4. Edit:
   - "YOUR EBOOK TITLE" - the title
   - "₦0,000" - the price
   - Short description
   - "ebooks/your-ebook-name.html" - must match the filename you created in Step 1


STEP 3: Update Global Settings
-------------------------------
Don't forget to update in BOTH files (homepage and ebook page):
- WhatsApp number: Replace "234XXXXXXXXXX" with your number
- Payment account details


TIPS
----
- Keep filenames simple: use lowercase and hyphens (example: relationship-advice.html)
- Make sure the "href" in index.html matches your filename exactly
- You can have as many ebooks as you want
- Each ebook gets its own unique shareable link


EXAMPLE
-------
If you create "ebooks/flirting-secrets.html", share it as:
https://your-replit-url.com/ebooks/flirting-secrets.html
