#### 💡 What is MiniPay?  
Opera recently launched **MiniPay**, a new stablecoin wallet built on blockchain.  
It’s safe, fast, and works even if the other person doesn’t have MiniPay yet.  

> To send money with MiniPay, generate a Cash Link in the app, share it with the recipient, and they can claim the funds instantly in their MiniPay wallet by clicking the link.  
> Alternatively, if the recipient also has a MiniPay account and phone number, you can send money directly to them using their phone number for a quick and simple transfer.

Once you’ve sent the Cash Link, message Lucy:  
> “Hi Lucy, I’ve paid for the ebook ❤️”  

Then she’ll confirm and send your copy immediately.
